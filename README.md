# bulletin-board-SEP
Software engineering internship project at the university of Passau in a team of 6. Based on PostgreSQL, JAVA and Jakarta Faces.

First time I've had a porject from the blank beginning to the end. We got specifications from our prof what should be included and created based on this document the specification sheet,
draft, fine specification, implementation (3 milestones) and validation of the project.

I were responsible for formulating the tests, the category navigation designed with prime-faces and the implementation of multiple pages (editCategory, categoryAdministration, userAdministration)

We went through multiple phases documented with specification book, draft, fine-specification, implementation-plan, implementation-report and validation-report.
